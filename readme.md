# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Oluwadamilola Oyaluade

I'm building public infrastructure & ML projects to demonstrate senior-level cloud, DevOps, and ML engineering capability.
# üè• Cloud Infra Bootstrapping for Healthcare Startup

This repo sets up secure AWS cloud infrastructure for a healthcare-focused SaaS product.
We will build everything using Terraform ‚Äî from IAM to EKS to ML model deployment.

---

## üß† Enterprise Scenario: *CareMesh Health*

**CareMesh Health** is a rapidly growing healthcare SaaS startup serving clinics and telehealth providers. They‚Äôre expanding from a single-region, single-account AWS setup into a secure, scalable, and regulated multi-account environment.

### üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Core Business Needs:
- HIPAA-compliant data storage & processing
- CI/CD pipelines for rapid deployment of patient-facing web apps and ML services
- A scalable architecture to support predictive analytics (e.g., patient no-shows, risk scoring)
- Team-based access separation: Dev, ML, Security, Compliance, and Production
- Cost transparency and control across business units

### üåê Cloud Infrastructure Goals:
1. **Multi-Account AWS Org** to isolate environments
2. **Terraform Modules** for repeatable networking and services
3. **EKS for App & ML Workloads** with GitHub Actions CI/CD
4. **Centralized Logging & Monitoring** for operations and incident response
5. **S3 + RDS + DynamoDB** as core data services
6. **MLflow + FastAPI + Prometheus/Grafana** stack for machine learning operations
7. **KMS, IAM SCPs, and GuardDuty** for security
