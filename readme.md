# 👋 Hi, I’m Oluwadamilola Oyaluade

I'm building **Cloud Infrastructure** and **ML Systems** to demonstrate expertise.
## 📺 Learn Along with Me (coming soon!!!)

Each module will come with:
- 🧑‍💻 **Code & Terraform**
- 📽️ **Architecture walkthrough video**
- 🖼️ **Infrastructure diagrams**
- 📄 **Obsidian-friendly documentation**
- 🔗 Shared across [GitHub](https://github.com/OOyaluade), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwadamilolaoyaluade), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@i_build_and_break_things), and [Twitter](#)

> [!NOTE] **Step by Step**  
> These projects are all centered around a fictitious health care company called `CareMersh Health` with thousands of users, employees, and stakeholders  
> The goal is to simulate real-world cloud architecture while demonstrating expertise in scalable and compliant infrastructure.
