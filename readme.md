# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Oluwadamilola Oyaluade

I'm building **Cloud Infrastructure** and **ML Systems** to demonstrate senior-level **Cloud, DevOps, and ML engineering** expertise.
## üì∫ Learn Along with Me

Each module will come with:
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Code & Terraform**
- üìΩÔ∏è **Architecture walkthrough video**
- üñºÔ∏è **Infrastructure diagrams**
- üìÑ **Obsidian-friendly documentation**
- üîó Shared across [GitHub](https://github.com/OOyaluade), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwadamilolaoyaluade), [YouTube](#), and [Twitter](#)

# Getting Started
## üè• Cloud Infra Bootstrapping for Healthcare Startup

This repository is the landing site. Links to provisioning secure and scalable AWS infrastructure using Terraform in a sequential manner are found in the table bellow.  
These links bootstraps everything from IAM to VPC networking to EKS; E.T.C ‚Äî powering a regulated, fast-moving healthcare SaaS.

## üß† Enterprise Scenario: *CareMesh Health*

**CareMesh Health** is expanding from a monolithic, single-account AWS setup into a secure multi-account, multi-region architecture.  
Their product suite includes telehealth apps, predictive analytics tools, and AI-powered services ‚Äî all of which must run on scalable, compliant infrastructure.

### üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Core Business Needs:
- HIPAA-compliant data storage & processing
- CI/CD pipelines for rapid deployment of patient-facing web apps and ML services
- A scalable architecture to support predictive analytics (e.g., patient no-shows, risk scoring)
- Team-based access separation: Dev, ML, Security, Compliance, and Production
- Cost transparency and control across business units

### üåê Cloud Infrastructure Goals:
1. **Multi-Account AWS Org** to isolate environments
2. **Terraform Modules** for repeatable networking and services
3. **EKS for App & ML Workloads** with GitHub Actions CI/CD
4. **Centralized Logging & Monitoring** for operations and incident response
5. **S3 + RDS + DynamoDB** as core data services
6. **MLflow + FastAPI + Prometheus/Grafana** stack for machine learning operations
7. **KMS, IAM SCPs, and GuardDuty** for security
